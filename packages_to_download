# servo (steering) (i2c address: 0x40)
sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685

# ESC (motor) (i2c address: 0x70)
also needs pca9685 package listed under "servo (steering)"

If you see error message: permission denied to '/dev/ttyUSB0', this is because the 'dev/ttyUSB0' device has the group of dialout. So you need to add current user to the dialout group, by typing: 
sudo adduser username dialout

you will need to log out and back in again for this to take effect.
